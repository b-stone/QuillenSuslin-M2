QuillenSuslin.m2
================
 
This package is joint with Brett Barwick. Using the algorithms in Logar-Sturmfels and Fabianska-Quadrat, this package computes a free basis of a projective module over a polynomial ring with coefficients in the rationals, integers, or a finite field.  It also provides methods to solve related problems involving completing a unimodular matrix to a square invertible matrix over a polynomial ring with coefficients in the rationals, integers, or a finite field, or a Laurent polynomial ring with coefficients in the rationals or a finite field.
